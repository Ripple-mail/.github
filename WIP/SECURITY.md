## Reporting a vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability, please help us keep users safe by following these steps:

1. **Do not open a public issue.**
2. **Email us at** [security@ripplemail.de](mailto:security@ripplemail.de) with:
    - A description of the vulnerability
    - Steps to reproduce (proof of concept, if possible).
    - Potential impact
3. We will respond within **72 hours**.
4. We will provide updates as we work to resolve the issue and may request additional information.

## What counts as a security vulnerability?
Please report things that could put users, data, or systems at risk. Examples include (but aren't limited to):
- Account takeover or authentication bypass
- Access to another user's email or data
- Remote code execution (e.g., XSS, RCE)
- Leaking sensitive information (emails, passwords, tokens, etc.)
- Breaking encryption or transport security (e.g., TLS issues)

You don't need to report:
- Typos, styling issues, or UX bugs
- Denial-of-service (DoS) or spam/flooding
- Social engineering attacks
- Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies we don't control (though letting us know about them is appreciated if they impact us)

## Scope
**In scope:**
- Our official code and services under `*.ripplemail.de`
- The Ripple Mail clients and APIs

**Out of scope:**
- DoS/spam/flooding attacks
- Social engineering
- Stuff outside Ripple Mail's control

## Responsible disclosure
- Please give us up to **90 days** to fix the issue before public disclosure.
- If you'd like credit, we'll happily mention you in our release notes/acknowledgements.
- Malicious or exploitative use of vulnerabilities is not permitted.
- We don't have a bug bounty programme, but we'll give you props for helping.

## Safe Harbour
As long as you're acting in **good faith**:
- You won't get in trouble with us for responsibly reporting an issue.
